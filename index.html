            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>The academic performance of students from KG1 to Grade 10 is evaluated under the C.B.S.E's Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation system (C.C.E).The system grades a student based on two modes of evaluation, the Formative Assessment system and the Summative Assessment system. The former system evaluates a child's performance objectively through an activity-based system where various academic activities pertinent to the subjects taught are held in order to assess a child's development. A holistic assessment of the child is the prime objective of the Formative Assessment system. The Summative Assessment system uses the traditional methods of evaluation where the child's knowledge, concepts and reasoning ability are tested through written examinations. There are four Formative Assessment tests, F.A.1, F.A.2, F.A.3 and F.A.4, where the first two assessments are held in the first term and the third and fourth tests conducted in the second term. Each term also contains a Summative assessment test with the S.A.1 conducted at the end of the first term and the S.A. 2 held at the end of the second term.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to TENS School life</h1>
    <p>Today's classrooms are no longer confined to the four walls of a room but to the portals in the distant corners of our world. Today's student processes far more information than any other generation of students have and the process of learning is a ceaseless journey where he/she is constantly challenged to innovate and adapt.
        <br>
        <br>
        We understand the importance of effective learning in a student and take it beyond their classrooms. Our school life is centered around various activities conducted throughout the year where students are given the opportunity to understand and explore fields that interest them through our mediums of clubs and societies, cultural events and exhibitions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our Students are divided into four houses in order to inculcate a healthy spirit of competition, sportsmanship and team building and reward them on their performance in various inter- house events conducted throughout the academic year.
        <br>
        <br>
        Opportunities are provided for students to participate in educational tours and events to enhance the learning experience beyond the available scope of learning in school.

                <p>Since transferring to The Emirates National School in 9th grade, it's felt like a second home. The teachers here are incredible. They're not just there to lecture; they push you to think critically and challenge yourself. My teacher even helped me develop my research skills for a national competition, which I won!</p>

                <p>As someone who used to struggle with math, I never thought I'd enjoy the subject. But the teachers at the Emirates National School completely changed that for me. Ms. Mincy has a way of explaining things that makes them click, and she offers extra help sessions whenever I need them. Now, I'm considering taking engineering.</p>
