            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>The academic performance of students from KG1 to Grade 10 is evaluated under the C.B.S.E's Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation system (C.C.E).The system grades a student based on two modes of evaluation, the Formative Assessment system and the Summative Assessment system. The former system evaluates a child's performance objectively through an activity-based system where various academic activities pertinent to the subjects taught are held in order to assess a child's development. A holistic assessment of the child is the prime objective of the Formative Assessment system. The Summative Assessment system uses the traditional methods of evaluation where the child's knowledge, concepts and reasoning ability are tested through written examinations. There are four Formative Assessment tests, F.A.1, F.A.2, F.A.3 and F.A.4, where the first two assessments are held in the first term and the third and fourth tests conducted in the second term. Each term also contains a Summative assessment test with the S.A.1 conducted at the end of the first term and the S.A. 2 held at the end of the second term.</p>
